title: About

I work as a Data Scientist in drug discovery research at GSK. I enjoy thinking of new ways to use data to accelerate the pace of research as we try to get new medicines to patients quicker. I have enjoyed the past [three years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-roohani-bb195231/) in industry working in the areas of compound screening, biomarker identification and systems pharmacology modeling. Along the way, I've had some success in designing robust machine learning systems that fit a healthcare context - from discovery all the way to diagnostics. I think artifical intelligence can bridge the many unnecessary divides in the healthcare industry, and I'd like to be a part of that change.

As you can tell from the tree, I enjoy the outdoors: I run, bike and swim but have never done a triathlon. I enjoy reading: especially history, historical fiction, constitutional and tax law. One of the most enjoyable things I did in college was to spend months brooding over the right way to divide power between different members in the debating society. I did this as I wrote a [detailed constitution](../Data/VIT_DebateSociety_Constitution.pdf) which ended up outliving my time in college by at least a few years. I also enjoy lanugages but am not as good as my wife who speaks at least five.
