I work as a data scientist in drug discovery research at GSK in Cambridge, MA. I think of new ways to use data as we try to get better medicines to patients quicker. My technical interests lie within learning novel representations that are specifically optimised for working across boundaries withing biomedical research. 

I have enjoyed the past [three years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-roohani-bb195231/) in industry emplying these skills towards compound screening, biomarker identification and systems pharmacology modeling. Along the way, I've had some success in designing robust machine learning systems that fit a healthcare context - from discovery all the way to diagnostics.

I like being outdoors: I run, bike and swim but have never done a triathlon. I like to read: especially history, historical fiction and tax law. I also enjoy lanugages but am not as good as my wife who speaks at least five.
