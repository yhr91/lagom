Problem solver with a background in computational engineering. Using data to accelerate the pace of research within drug discovery and personalized medicine. I have enjoyed the past [three years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-roohani-bb195231/) in industry working in the areas of compound screening, biomarker identification and systems pharmacology modeling. Along the way, I've had some success in designing robust machine learning systems that fit a healthcare context.
