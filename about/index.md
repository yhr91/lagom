I work on designing new ways to use data as we try to get better medicines to patients quicker. Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at Stanford University advised by [Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/). I'm affiliated with the [Department of Biomedical Data Science](https://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html), [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/people.html) and the [Stanford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://statsml.stanford.edu/index.html). 

My interests lie in the application of machine learning and graph based representations for high throughput experiment design. I previously worked as a machine learning engineer at GSK in Cambridge, MA where I led a cross-disciplinary team on a project to biologically profile their 2M+ compound collection. I have enjoyed the past [four years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-roohani-bb195231/) in industry designing robust machine learning systems that fit a healthcare context - from discovery all the way to diagnostics.
